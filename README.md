Web Automation Framework using IExplorer Object

Hello, My name is Ronan Vico, Analyst and VBA Consultant. https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronan-vico/

I created a framework after many years asking me for advice and tips on web automation, as I became a "specialist" in this after 1 consecutive year of web application automation (using IE, Selenium and httprequests).

I made IE startup easy, bypassing Errors, and making browsing more intuitive. I made it easier to get to the elements, and wait for those elements on the page. I facilitated the automation of windows to save, open and etc.

I am available for questions and / or framework improvements over time.
